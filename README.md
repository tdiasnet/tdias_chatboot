# 🤖 tdias_chatboot

## 🚀 Project Vision

**tdias_chatboot** is an open-source initiative designed to demonstrate my ability to design, structure, and deploy complex AI systems using state-of-the-art open-source technologies. The core of this project relies on the **Mistral family of models**, which are open-weight, commercially-permissible Large Language Models (LLMs).

The goal is to create a **scalable, intelligent chatbot solution** suitable for **commercial use** — as either a **SaaS (Software as a Service)** offering or an **on-premises deployment** — capable of handling HelpDesk and customer support tasks across various text-based platforms, such as:

- WhatsApp
- Web-based chat interfaces
- Mobile applications
- Internal support systems

This repository represents the **public and generic version** of the project. Therefore, it **intentionally omits proprietary datasets, business logic, and secret configurations**, focusing solely on the **architecture, infrastructure, and development pipeline**. This structure showcases my ability to:

✅ Design scalable architectures  
✅ Implement CI/CD pipelines  
✅ Work with containerized environments (Docker, Compose)  
✅ Deploy machine learning models  
✅ Use modern frameworks and tools for model serving and API development (e.g., FastAPI)  
✅ Adhere to software engineering best practices  

---

## 🎯 Why this matters?

By working exclusively with **open-source tools and models with commercial-friendly licenses**, I am planning this project for future **productization** without legal constraints.

This repository serves as:

✅ A **portfolio piece** to demonstrate my technical proficiency in AI, MLOps, and software engineering.  
✅ A **foundation** for further development into a **production-grade system** with enhanced capabilities such as logging, monitoring, advanced conversational workflows, and analytics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Overview

- **Model:** Mistral 7B (Open source, commercially usable)  
- **Inference API:** FastAPI  
- **Orchestration:** Docker + docker-compose  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Deployment Ready:** Azure, AWS, or self-hosted infrastructure

## 📌 Important Note

This repository does **not include**:

❌ Proprietary data  
❌ Trained model weights (only structure placeholders)  
❌ Business-specific logic  

Everything here is **safe, generic**, and intended to demonstrate the **architecture and process**, not the actual product.
